What is Tetris and how to play this?

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game. It is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called "tetriminos", descend from the top of the field.During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it. 

The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many horizontal lines of blocks as possible. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank. Completing lines grants points, and accumulating a certain number of points moves the player up a level, which increases the number of points granted per completed line.

Sketch UI and the main functions         
 
An elegant  Tetris game board with various Tetris shapes will be implemented
Keyboard movement will be created to move the blocks
‘Levels’ feature will be created for the player to move to the next level
Current Score and High Score information will be shown up on the interface
A timer will be set to track the game time
‘Pause’ and ‘Resume’ options will be provided for the player to stop the game in between and continue from there
The interface will have visually appealing design and background image
Music feature will be implemented to produce different sounds when the game is being played
The interface will follow all the ‘Golden Rules & Principles’ such as consistency, color, background, font, size etc that is covered in the class

How far did you go with the implementation?

We did set up the game board and a background image and will add other features soon

The plan to move forward?

We will create different blocks and levels first and then add music, timer and other features
