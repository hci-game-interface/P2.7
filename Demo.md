  Use the controls with the help of a keyboard and play the game. When all the cells of a row of the game board are occupied we say that the line is cleared and the score comes up and the player sees the raise in the 'lines' as well. When the player achieves the score of 100, the player moves to the next level and this keeps going. The high score will be shown to the player to check the highest score made in the game.

The game of Tetris is played on a rectangular board consisting of square (initially empty) cells. The board is of fixed and seven game pieces can be used, each covering board cells usually called blocks. These pieces are known as (from left to right) --> O or square, 
--> J or leftgun,
--> L or rightgun, 
--> I or dash, 
--> Z or leftsnake, 
--> S or rightsnake, and T or tee:

This interface generates a sequence of pieces that drop down from the top of the board until they rest on top of  previously dropped pieces or on the bottom of the game board. The user/player can determine the position and orientation of the pieces
by rotating and moving them horizontally while they fall. 

Lines : Whenever all the cells of a row (also called line) of the game board are occupied, the line is cleared; all blocks above it are lowered by one row (and no more). This row clearing can happen for several lines simultaneously.

Level : Based on the score achieved, the player will move to the next level. Score required to move to the 2nd level is 100.

Score & High Score : When the player forms a line, the score keeps adding up and the raise depends on how well the player is constructing the blocks. High Score is the highest score achieved by the player in the game.

Background Music : There is a music set in the game background and this starts when the player starts the game.
